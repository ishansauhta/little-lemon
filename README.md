## Little Lemon Web-Application

This project was created using a popular tool called Create React App.

## Available Commands

In the project directory, you can run various commands using npm:

* **Start (npm start):** Starts the development server and opens your app in the browser at http://localhost:3000. Your app will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.
* **Test (npm test):** Runs the test suite for your app.
* **Build (npm run build):** Creates an optimized production build of your app in the `build` folder. This build is ready to be deployed to a web server.
* **Eject (npm run eject - Caution!):** This is a one-way operation! This command removes the build tools used by Create React App and copies their configuration files directly into your project. This gives you full control over the build process but is generally not recommended unless you have specific customization needs.
